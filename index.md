## Petriam

Petriam is a mobile application to serve the people with pets while they are unable to take care of their pets during their time outside their homes. The project aims to favor both sides of its target group which are hosts and clients. Using Petriam, clients who are pet owners could list the possible temporary homes for their pets while hosts who may or may not be pet owners can earn money by taking care of the pets of their clients. Users can enter their information regarding themselves and their pets. The hosts could view their offers on the application and message with the users if they require more information about the pets before accepting or rejecting offers.
