            <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>
            &emsp;Animal domestication is nearly as old as the history of humans that
            have been ongoing for nearly 10,000 years [1]. Although the reason behind
            domestication of the first animals and pet ownership of today is not the same,
            it is undeniable that animals and humans have been in a close relationship
            between each other for a considerable amount of time. This relationship
            between pets and humans have become more intimate as people started to
            own pets for social purposes that created an industry for this purpose. Studies
            show that pet ownership in the USA has increased from 56% to 70% percent
            in the last 30 years [2]. It is also important to note that this industry has a
            market size of $103.6 billion as of 2020 [3].
            </p>
            <p>
            &emsp;With the technological developments of the last decades, travelling has
            become so convenient that it is possible for a person to travel around the
            world in less than a week. This advancement in transportation has affected the
            lives of the people that make them travel more and more whether it is for
            business purposes or for fun. The problem begins when people with pets need
            to travel as travel companies have strict rules against pet luggage. Although it
            is possible for pet owners to travel with their pets, it is not always healthy for
            the pets to travel for such long distances. For this reason, places such as pet
            hotels have been founded to provide shelter for the pets while their owners
            are gone. However, not that those hotels are expensive, they are not available
            in every city.
            </p>
            <p>
            &emsp;What makes pet ownership hard is the financial requirements to buy the
            necessary equipment such as litter box, toys, scratching tools and combs. As
            soon as the necessary tools are bought then it becomes a matter of choice to
            choose how many pets will be taken care of. For example, the listed
            equipment can be shared among 3 different cats. Knowing that pet owners
            can have more pets in their homes without having to buy additional equipment. 
            This availability of homes can be used as a supply to the demand
            of pet hotels in a cheaper manner while making hosts earn money and pet
            owners safely travel without worrying about their pets. This report briefly
            introduces the application Petriam which is planned to be implemented in
            order to address this issue.
            </p>
            1.1 Description
            Petriam is a mobile application to serve the people with pets while they
            are unable to take care of their pets during their time outside their homes. The
            project aims to favor both sides of its target group which are hosts and clients.
            Using Petriam, clients who are pet owners could list the possible temporary
            homes for their pets while hosts who may or may not be pet owners can earn
            money by taking care of the pets of their clients.
            Petriam will be focusing on the specific service of pet accommodations
            for the time being to accurately deliver a solution to the problem. In the
            application, a client could reserve a date for their pet, get in contact with the
            host, ask their questions and rate them at the end of their stay. On the other
            hand, hosts could accept or reject a reservation depending on the client and
            describe their services to the clients. In simpler words, Petriam will be a free
            marketplace for people who are looking for hosts and people who want to earn
            money by taking care of pets. Surely, the host registration process will have
            extra verification steps than the user registration process in order to create a
            trusting environment in the application. What makes Petriam an investment
            worthy application is that Petriam is only the middleman in this process. While
            correctly solving the issue, Petriam will not own any pets or pet homes to
            minimize expenditures. The main difference between Petriam and other pet
            care applications is that Petriam is the only mobile application that solely
            addresses this issue.
            4
            Moreover, by not relying on pet hotels, less waste is created by using
            Petriam since Petriam favors the principle of sharing rather than buying new
            equipment for pets. Pet hotels are expensive to maintain in terms of resources
            such as electricity. water and gas which are used in much higher amounts
            compared to a regular house. Thanks to Petriam, leaving pets during travels
            will be cheaper, environmentally safer and economically sustainable.
            1.2 Constraints
            1.2.1 Implementation
            ● Trello will be used to organize workload and create an agile
            environment for development.

            and App Store.
            ● Google Play Store, App Store and some services such as databases
            will require a fee for development.
            5
            ● Users who use the application as pet hosts can gain extra money on
            this platform by hosting people’s pets for a certain amount of time.
            ● Users who want to find a place for their pets pay less money compared
            to the alternative places like animal hotels.
            1.2.3 Social
            ● There will be a relationship based on trust between both hosts and pet
            owners since pet owners give the pet and hosts keep their animals safe.
            ● There is a rating system that pet owners rate hosts based on the
            service and care that hosts provide.
            1.2.4 Ethical
            ● All members of the project will be abiding by the ethical code of National
            Society of Professional Engineers [4].

            1.2.6 Sustainability
            ● Animals will be safe and taken care of with the resources that are
            currently available such as houses of people, foods of pets in people’s
            houses.
            ● The application will take commissions from the transactions between
            pet owners and hosts so that the cost of maintaining the platform will be
            paid by the users.
            6
            1.3. Ethical and Professional Responsibilities
            When it comes to realizing this project, there are multiple ethical and
            professional concerns that need to be addressed. In order to be able to use
            this project, users need to register to the system and they need to provide
            some information related to them. Since this kind of data can be personal and
            sensitive, as a group we will not share or publish provided data by the user
            with any person, organization or company. We are not going to request any
            data that is irrelevant or unnecessary to this project from the user. Only the
            minimum necessary amount of data will be gathered from the user. If a user
            needs to record sound, video or picture through our project, we are going to
            ask permission from the user about using the respective component of their
            device like camera or voice recorder to gather such information from them.
            These measures are needed to protect the private and sensitive data of the
            user while using the project.
            By using our project, users are going to entrust their pets to other users
            who are hosts. Since they are entrusting their beloved pets to other people
            that they met through our project. So, safety of the pets needs to be provided
            to the user and users who are hosts need to be trustable. To provide a
            trustworthy environment for the users, review and verification mechanisms will
            be used. By these mechanisms, safety of the users’ pets will be ensured by
            only allowing users who are verified and have good reviews become hosts.
            This will help improve the trust between the users and hosts.
            7
            2. Requirements
            2.1 Functional Requirements
            2.1.1 Sign-up Sign-in Capabilities
            Sign-up and sign-in capabilities are some of the most important parts of
            our application. Because the authenticity of the users is playing a key part in
            strong trust between users who will take care of pets and consign their
            beloved pets. In Petriam we will require the user to sign-up and sign-in before
            proceeding to use other functionalities of the application. The overhead of the
            sign-up/in processes will be minimized for the basic user account in order to
            have better ease of use of the application. And there will be a host account
            option that can be directly created in registration or upgraded from a basic
            user account.
            2.1.2 Be Host
            Users that have the basic accounts will be able to upgrade their account
            to a host account which will have the option to be a host that will be listed in
            the search results of the users that are looking for a host. In order to upgrade
            a basic account user must supply various information such as location,
            caregiving price, owned pets, pet types preferred to take care of, user info,
            etc. And they are also required to verify their real identifiers such as telephone
            number and identification card by getting through the verification process.
            2.1.3 Look for Host
            Users will be able to search for hosts based on a lot of varying filter
            parameters such as auto location or manual address input, price, rating,
            accepted pet type, pets owned by the host, verification level of host, etc. After
            filtering the caregiving users according to the given parameters, they will be
            8
            listed in a basic detailed manner which will be ordered by their ratings by
            default. But the user will have the ability to order results by the parameters
            that they prefer.
            2.1.4 Check Details and Start Conversation
            After finding the host by filtering the options that are listed as a result of
            the host search, the user will be able to go to the detail page of the host which
            has detailed information and introductory text that are not displayed on the
            listing page. If the user makes his/her final decision on trusting the host with
            the pet he/she can proceed by starting a conversation with the host using the
            messaging functionality of the application.
            2.1.5 Messaging the Host
            The user will contact the host and arrange the rest of the caregiving
            details by using the messaging section of the application. As a sensitive
            information, users will not be able to see each other’s phone numbers on this
            messaging section. And messages in this section will be stored in our
            database as they constitute evidence for the banning decisions and also to
            prevent false accusations between users. Users will be warned to not use the
            app as a messaging app and will be encouraged to always use the messaging
            section for communicating with the host in order to record every action that
            has taken place between users and stay safe.
            2.2 Non-functional Requirements
            2.2.1 Usability
            The user interface of the system must be simple and user-friendly. The
            target of the Petriam will be people with pets of all ages. Therefore, it should
            not require exercise knowledge.
            9
            2.2.2 Supportability
            The system should be able to work in both Android and iOS devices
            and compatible with any third-party APIs such as Google Maps.
            2.2.3 Reliability
            The system must not crash easily and roll-back in case of any failure in
            the server.
            2.2.4 Efficiency
            The delay between a user requesting the list of cat hosts and it being
            listed on the screen should not exceed 5 seconds.
            2.2.5 Security
            User information must be kept securely with using encryption and must
            not be accessible to third parties.
            2.2.6 Scalability
            The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent users
            at the same time.
